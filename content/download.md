## Source code

The MISP [source code](https://github.com/MISP/MISP)  is available on GitHub, including documentation and scripts for installation.

[ChangeLog](/Changelog.txt) contains a detailed list of updates for each software release in the core of the MISP software.

## Installation
### Requirements
MISP is written using PHP, and several of the components use Python. To install MISP you will need a server with PHP 7.4, and a webserver capable of rendering PHP (i.e. Apache or Nginx). 
When it comes to MISP and PHP 8.0, [read this](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/README.md#php-and-misp).


MISP can thus easily be installed on any standard GNU/Linux distribution. Common and recommended distributions are the current stable versions of Red Hat, Debian or Ubuntu. 
The only official supported method of installing MISP is 

Installation guides for various distributions are included in the [INSTALL directory](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/2.4/INSTALL). If you did a git clone of MISP for the installation, an [UPDATE procedure is available](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/INSTALL/UPDATE.txt) to keep your MISP up-to-date.




<!-- 
Install script - should really be tested on 
Red Hat (trial?) 8+9  (add to CI?)

Install script - should really be tested on re-tested on
Ubuntu 20.04.2  (add to CI?)

MISP Install guides (stock install instructions for getting a base MISP system running) are available at [https://misp.github.io/MISP/](https://misp.github.io/MISP/).

### Requirements

### Recommended distribution

We recommend to use a recent and stable Ubuntu distribution (such as 22.04) for deploying MISP.

### Virtual images for testing

If you would like to test MISP and don't want to do an installation, CIRCL generates automatically VMware images and VirtualBox at each MISP core commit. Available at [https://vm.misp-project.org/](https://vm.misp-project.org/). The image is to be used for testing purposes only, production-use is considered to be dangerous as is, it contains much more than MISP alone but also misp-dashboard and viper which requires additional security review before being in production.

The default credentials for the automatically generated virtual machines are the following:

~~~~
For the MISP web interface -> admin@admin.test:admin
For the system -> misp:Password1234
~~~~
#### VirtualBox
Please add the following forwards on your VM Host:
~~~~
VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 www,tcp,,8080,,80
VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 ssh,tcp,,2222,,22
VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 dashboard,tcp,,8001,,8001
~~~~
#### VMWare Users
Log in on the VM using the console, and change the baseurl to the IP address of your VM.
~~~~
sudo -u www-data /var/www/MISP/app/Console/cake Baseurl https://a.b.c.d
sudo systemctl restart apache2
~~~~
